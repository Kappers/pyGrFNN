Gradient Frequency Neural Networks in Python
============================================

Dependencies
----

 - PyDSTool
 - NumPy
 - SciPy
 - Matplotlib


Documentation
-----

To generate the documentation I'm using Sphinx. The theme is the *ReadTheDocs* theme, that can be found [here](https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme) (it includes instructions on how to install and use it)


Notes
----
This repo was intended to use `virtualenv`, but for some reason, `virtualenv` and `matplotlib` decided to not like each other, so in the mean time I'm using the system-site-packages (at least for NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib)
