Gradient Frequency Neural Networks in Python
============================================

**Author** : jorgeh
**Date** : May, 2014


Dependencies
------------

 <!-- - PyDSTool -->
 - NumPy
 - SciPy
 - Matplotlib
 - Sphinx (to build docs)
 - sphinxcontrib-napoleon (to build docs)
 - Nose (testing)


Documentation
-------------

To generate the documentation I'm using [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/). The theme is the *ReadTheDocs* theme, that can be found [here](https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme) (it includes instructions on how to install and use it)


Notes
-----
This repo was intended to use `virtualenv`, but for some reason, `virtualenv` and `matplotlib` decided to not like each other, so in the mean time I'm using the system-site-packages (at least for NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib)
